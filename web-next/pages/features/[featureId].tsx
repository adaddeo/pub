          in butcher paper. It oils our lips.
          <br />
          Out for a swim my flesh picks up
          <br />
          on what it otherwise evades—
          <br />
          the dark mineral echo
          <br />
          under sunlight’s ricochet,
          <br />
          a shadow that feathers
          <br />
          at my heels. The neighbor boy dives
          <br />
          like a cygnet of careless bones
          <br />
          and webbing. New record, he reemerges,
          <br />
          shaking his glistening neck.
          <br />
          I know better than to fear
          <br />
          the silt-curled snakes,
          <br />
          but the undertow pimples me.
          <br />
          Any slithering demon’s iron mouth
          <br />
          can break the water’s cradle.
          <br />
          Красота бешиная! Aunt yells from the bank.
          <br />
          What mad beauty! I dive and spread
          <br />
          into a flapping sheet. Every hair lifts
          <br />
          to the surface, a field of wind-blown wheat.
